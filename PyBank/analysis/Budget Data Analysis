In this file we will analyze our financial records of our
company to figure out our profit/losses over an entire 
period of time and our increase and decrease of profits.
I will need to calcuate the total months, total amount 
money, average change of profits, greatest increase of
profits and lastly decrease of profits. In my predicton 
i summed that we would have more of a greater increase 
of profits rather than a decrease.
